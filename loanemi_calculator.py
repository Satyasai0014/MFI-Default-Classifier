These players differ in their regulatory structure, outreach, and business models. Here's a breakdown of the key participants:
            
            - **`NBFC-MFIs (Non-Banking Financial Companies - Microfinance Institutions)`**: 39%  
              These are specialized financial institutions focused primarily on microfinance. They have the largest share in the sector.
            
            - **`Banks`**: 33%  
              Commercial banks play a major role by directly offering microloans or lending to MFIs for onward lending.
            
            - **`SFBs (Small Finance Banks)`**: 16%  
              SFBs are newer entities aimed at promoting financial inclusion, and they have a growing presence in microfinance.
            
            - **`NBFCs (Non-Banking Financial Companies)`**: 11%  
              Though not exclusively focused on microfinance, these entities contribute significantly through partnerships and lending.
            
            - **`Others`**: 1%  
              This includes cooperatives, NGOs, and other informal players involved in micro-lending.
            
            These players collectively form the backbone of Indiaâs financial inclusion efforts by expanding access to credit and empowering underserved communities.

            <p>
            The <strong>Exposure Calculator</strong> is a core feature of our loan management system designed to provide a transparent view of the customerâs outstanding obligations at any point in time.
            </p>
            
            <h3>What is Exposure?</h3>
            <p>
            In lending , <strong>exposure</strong> refers to the potential risk a lender faces from a borrower's failure to repay a loan, representing the total amount the lender could lose if the borrowerÂ defaults.
            </p> 
          
            
            <h3> How Does It Work?</h3>
            <p>Our exposure calculation engine dynamically computes exposure based on the payment schedule and actual payments made by the borrower. Here's what it considers:</p>
            
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Principal Due:</strong> The portion of the loan amount that was scheduled to be paid.</li>
              <li><strong>Interest Due:</strong> Interest applicable for the period based on the outstanding balance.</li>
              <li><strong>Outstanding Amount:</strong> Any unpaid principal or interest carried forward from previous periods.</li>
              <li><strong>DPD (Days Past Due):</strong> Delayed payments increase the overdue amount and exposure.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>
            Each time the schedule is updated or a payment is made, the calculator recalculates exposure accordingly â helping stakeholders track risk in <strong>real-time</strong>.
            </p>
            
            <h3> Why It Matters</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Assists in <strong>risk assessment</strong> and <strong>portfolio monitoring</strong>.</li>
              <li>Useful for <strong>collections</strong>, <strong>NPA tracking</strong>, and <strong>credit decisioning</strong>.</li>
              <li>Provides a clear view of <strong>who owes how much and why</strong>.</li>
            </ul>
